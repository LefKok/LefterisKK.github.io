## About

I am a graduate researcher at **[EPFL](https://people.epfl.ch/eleftherios.kokoriskogias?lang=en)** working on Decentralized Systems, Applied Cryptography and Distributed Computing. 

I received my MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the National Techinical University of Athens and worked as an undergraduate researcher at the Distributed Knowledge and Media Systems Group at NTUA.

## Research

I am interested in increasing the digital trust of online information and processes, especially those that impact the physical world.
I am working on building a scalable and robust infrastructure for the future decentralised internet focusing on scalable blockchain systems, bias-resistant decentralised randomness generation, secure software update dispersion and novel applications of threshold cryptography and distributed consensus.
